There are two primary classes of anchors: temporary and permanent. A permanent anchor is used in the creation of a mooring, and is rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain it. Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors which may be of different designs and weights."@en .
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keel> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In boats and ships, keel can refer to either of two parts: a structural element, or a hydrodynamic element. These parts overlap. As the laying down of the keel is the initial step in construction of a ship, in British and American shipbuilding traditions the construction is dated from this event. Only the ship's launching is considered more significant in its creation. The word can also be used to refer to a complete boat, as in keelboat or Humber keel."@en .
